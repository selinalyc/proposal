# Music Controlled LED

I propose to build a music controlled LED that the lED light will flash depends on the music's beats.

## Summary

The music controlled LED is a LED strip that connects to Arduino, which controlled by computer. A sensor of microphone is on the bread board to collect the sound from the environment/outside of the computer. The coding is referred to the Neopixel library. When the volume is higher than some value the light of LED will light on, else it will light off.

The main goal of the project is epecially for the music lovers. This project visuallized the music played in the light reaction. It makes people feel more connected to the music.


## Component Parts

- LED Strip
- Microphone sensor
- Arduino
- Breadboard
- Wires


## Challenges
The hardest part is I have to make sure both wire connection and coding works at the same time. Also, the sensibility of the microphone is not stable, It's hard to make it in the right value.

## Timeline

What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks?

- Week 1: Write proposal, 
- Week 2: Acquire hardware components: current sensor, WiFi, and build a prototype circuit with those pieces.
- Week 3: Build a first version of the software that perform light flashing to the music beats
- Week 4: Integrate all the components together and debug.
- Week 5: Present complete project.
